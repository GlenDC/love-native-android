### Usage

The port contains a launcher activity (LoveLauncher) that is capable of starting any .love files on the android phone.

It is possible to bundle a game. All content from the assets/ folder is available (like executing love assets/). Therefore placing extracted game files (main.lua, ...) into assets/ and starting the LoveNative activity will directly launch the game.
